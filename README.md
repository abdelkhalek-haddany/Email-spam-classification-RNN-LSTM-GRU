# Email Spam Classification using RNN, GRU, and LSTM

This project demonstrates the implementation of email spam classification using advanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). It includes both theoretical explanations and practical coding examples to help you understand how these deep learning techniques can be applied to real-world data for spam detection.

## Introduction

Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, and deep learning models have significantly improved spam classification accuracy. In this project, we explore three types of deep learning models—RNN, GRU, and LSTM—to classify emails as spam or not spam.

### Key Features:
- Comparison of RNN, GRU, and LSTM models
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Step-by-step guide to building each model
- Evaluation of model performance
## NNs Used

- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- LSTM ( Long Short Term Memory)

## Installation
